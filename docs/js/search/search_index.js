While the original standard DOES NOT allow this for SPAs, the mentioned OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice document proposes to ease this limitation. However, it specifies a list of requirements one should take care about before using refresh_tokens. Please make sure you respect those requirements.\nPlease also note, that you have to request the offline_access scope to get an refresh token.\nTo refresh your token, just call the refreshToken method:\nthis.oauthService.refreshToken();Automatically refreshing a token when/ before it expires (Code Flow and Implicit Flow)\nTo automatically refresh a token when/ some time before it expires, just call the following method after configuring the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.setupAutomaticSilentRefresh();By default, this event is fired after 75% of the token's life time is over. You can adjust this factor by setting the property timeoutFactor to a value between 0 and 1. For instance, 0.5 means, that the event is fired after half of the life time is over and 0.33 triggers the event after a third.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/silent-refresh.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/silent-refresh.html","title":"additional-page - Silent Refresh","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nRefreshing when using Implicit Flow (Implicit Flow and Code Flow)\nNotes for Code Flow: You can also use this strategy for refreshing tokens when using code flow. However, please note, the strategy described within Token Refresh is far easier in this case.\nTo refresh your tokens when using implicit flow you can use a silent refresh. This is a well-known solution that compensates the fact that implicit flow does not allow for issuing a refresh token. It uses a hidden iframe to get another token from the auth server. When the user is there still logged in (by using a cookie) it will respond without user interaction and provide new tokens.\nTo use this approach, setup a redirect uri for the silent refresh.\nFor this, you can set the property silentRefreshRedirectUri in the config object:\n// This api will come in the next version\n\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user after silent refresh\n  silentRefreshRedirectUri: window.location.origin + '/silent-refresh.html',\n\n  // defaults to true for implicit flow and false for code flow\n  // as for code code the default is using a refresh_token\n  // Also see docs section 'Token Refresh'\n  useSilentRefresh: true,\n\n  // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\n\n  // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n  // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n}As an alternative, you can set the same property directly with the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.silentRefreshRedirectUri = window.location.origin + \"/silent-refresh.html\";Please keep in mind that this uri has to be configured at the auth-server too.\nThis file is loaded into the hidden iframe after getting new tokens. Its only task is to send the received tokens to the main application:\n\n\n    \n        (window.opener || window.parent).postMessage(location.hash || ('#' + location.search), location.origin);\n    \n\nThis simple implementation within silent-refresh.html is sufficient in most cases. It takes care of the hash fragment as well as of the query string (property search). For edge cases you need to check if the received hash fragment is a token response. For this, please go with the following more advanced implementation:\n\n    \n        \n            var checks = [/[\\?|&|#]code=/, /[\\?|&|#]error=/, /[\\?|&|#]token=/, /[\\?|&|#]id_token=/];\n\n            function isResponse(str) {\n                var count = 0;\n                if (!str) return false;\n                for(var i=0; i\n    \nPlease make sure that this file is copied to your output directory by your build task. When using the CLI you can define it as an asset for this. For this, you have to add the following line to the file .angular-cli.json:\n\"assets\": [\n    [...],\n    \"silent-refresh.html\"\n],To perform a silent refresh, just call the following method:\nthis\n    .oauthService\n    .silentRefresh()\n    .then(info => console.debug('refresh ok', info))\n    .catch(err => console.error('refresh error', err));When there is an error in the iframe that prevents the communication with the main application, silentRefresh will give you a timeout. To configure the timespan for this, you can set the property silentRefreshTimeout (msec). The default value is 20.000 (20 seconds).\nAutomatically refreshing a token when/ before it expires (Code Flow and Implicit Flow)\nTo automatically refresh a token when/ some time before it expires, just call the following method after configuring the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.setupAutomaticSilentRefresh();By default, this event is fired after 75% of the token's life time is over. You can adjust this factor by setting the property timeoutFactor to a value between 0 and 1. For instance, 0.5 means, that the event is fired after half of the life time is over and 0.33 triggers the event after a third.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/working-with-httpinterceptors.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/working-with-httpinterceptors.html","title":"additional-page - Working with HttpInterceptors","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nInterceptors\nSince 3.1 the library uses a default HttpInterceptor that takes care about transmitting the access_token to the resource server and about error handling for security related errors (HTTP status codes 401 and 403) received from the resource server. To put in on, just set sendAccessToken to true and set allowedUrls to an array with prefixes for the respective urls. Use lower case for the prefixes:\nOAuthModule.forRoot({\n    resourceServer: {\n        allowedUrls: ['http://www.angular.at/api'],\n        sendAccessToken: true\n    }\n})You can provide an error handler for the urls white listed here by provding a service for the token OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler.\nTo implement such a service, implement the abstract class OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler. The following example shows the default implemantion that just passes the cought error through:\nexport class OAuthNoopResourceServerErrorHandler implements OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler {\n\n    handleError(err: HttpResponse): Observable {\n        return _throw(err);\n    }\n\n}Custom Interceptors\nFeel free to write custom interceptors but keep in mind that injecting the OAuthService into them creates a circular dependency which leads to an error. The easiest way to prevent this is to use the OAuthStorage directly which also provides the access_token:\nimport { Injectable, Inject, Optional } from '@angular/core';\nimport { OAuthService, OAuthStorage } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\nimport { HttpEvent, HttpHandler, HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpErrorResponse } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';\nimport { OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler } from \"./resource-server-error-handler\";\nimport { OAuthModuleConfig } from \"../oauth-module.config\";\n\nimport 'rxjs/add/operator/catch';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class DefaultOAuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\n\n    constructor(\n        private authStorage: OAuthStorage,\n        private errorHandler: OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler,\n        @Optional() private moduleConfig: OAuthModuleConfig\n    ) {\n    }\n\n    private checkUrl(url: string): boolean {\n        let found = this.moduleConfig.resourceServer.allowedUrls.find(u => url.startsWith(u));\n        return !!found;\n    }\n\n    public intercept(req: HttpRequest, next: HttpHandler): Observable> {\n\n        let url = req.url.toLowerCase();\n\n        if (!this.moduleConfig) return next.handle(req);\n        if (!this.moduleConfig.resourceServer) return next.handle(req);\n        if (!this.moduleConfig.resourceServer.allowedUrls) return next.handle(req);\n        if (!this.checkUrl(url)) return next.handle(req);\n\n        let sendAccessToken = this.moduleConfig.resourceServer.sendAccessToken;\n\n        if (sendAccessToken) {\n\n            let token = this.authStorage.getItem('access_token');\n            let header = 'Bearer ' + token;\n\n            let headers = req.headers\n                                .set('Authorization', header);\n\n            req = req.clone({ headers });\n        }\n\n        return next.handle(req).catch(err => this.errorHandler.handleError(err));\n\n    }\n\n}\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/callback-after-login.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/callback-after-login.html","title":"additional-page - Callback after login","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nCallback after login\nThere is a callback onTokenReceived, that is called after a successful login. In this case, the lib received the access_token as\nwell as the id_token, if it was requested.

For this, you need to do two things:\n\nUse initLoginFlowInPopup instead of initLoginFlow.\nCreate and configure a silent-refresh.html as described here *.\n\n* Please note this does not mean that you have to use silent refresh too.\nAlso, for your silent-regfesh.html, make sure you are also targeting\nwindow.opener and fall back to window.parent:\nPlease note: IE sets opener to null under specific security settings.

This prevents the library from reading them. To avoid this, disable initial navigation when setting up the routes for your root module:\nexport let AppRouterModule = RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES, {\n    useHash: true,\n    initialNavigation: false\n});After tryLogin did its job, you can manually perform the initial navigation:\nthis.oauthService.tryLogin().then(_ => {\n    this.router.navigate(['/']);\n})Another solution is the use a redirect uri that already contains the initial route. In this case the router will not override it. An example for such a redirect uri is\n    http://localhost:8080/#/home\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/adapt-id_token-validation.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/adapt-id_token-validation.html","title":"additional-page - Adapt id_token Validation","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nConfigure/ Adapt id_token Validation\nYou can hook in an implementation of the interface TokenValidator to validate the signature of the received id_token and its at_hash property. This packages provides two implementations:\n\nJwksValidationHandler\nNullValidationHandler\n\nThe former one validates the signature against public keys received via the discovery document (property jwks) and the later one skips the validation on client side.\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\n\n[...]\n\nthis.oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();In cases where no ValidationHandler is defined, you receive a warning on the console. This means that the library wants you to explicitly decide on this.\nDependency Injection\nYou can also setup a ValidationHandler by leveraging dependency injection:\n[...]\nproviders: [\n    { provide: ValidationHandler, useClass: JwksValidationHandler },\n],\n[...]\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/session-checks.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/session-checks.html","title":"additional-page - Session Checks","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nSession Checks\nBeginning with version 2.1, you can receive a notification when the user signs out with the identity provider.\nThis is implemented as defined by the OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 spec.\nWhen this option is activated, the library also automatically ends your local session. This means, the current tokens\nare deleted by calling logOut. In addition to that, the library sends a session_terminated event, you can register\nfor to perform a custom action.\nPlease note that this option can only be used when also the identity provider in question supports it.\nConfiguration\nTo activate the session checks that leads to the mentioned notifications, set the configuration property\nsessionChecksEnabled:\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n  silentRefreshRedirectUri: window.location.origin + '/silent-refresh.html',\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n\n  // Activate Session Checks:\n  sessionChecksEnabled: true,\n}Refresh\nPlease note that the lib performs a token refresh when the session changes to get the newest information about the current session. When using implicit flow, this means you have to configure silent refresh; when using code flow you either need silent refresh or a refresh token.\nIf using refresh tokens, your Auth Server needs to bind them to the current session's lifetime. Unfortunately, the used version of Identity Server 4, shown in the docs and in the example applications, does not support this at the moment.\nEvents\nTo get notified, you can hook up for the event session_terminated:\nthis.oauthService.events.pipe(filter(e => e.type === 'session_terminated')).subscribe(e => {\n  console.debug('Your session has been terminated!');\n})\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/server-side-rendering.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/server-side-rendering.html","title":"additional-page - Server Side Rendering","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nServer Side Rendering\nThere is a great blog post that shows how this library can be used together with server side rendering:\nhttps://medium.com/lankapura/angular-server-side-rendering-for-authenticated-users-a021627fd9d3The sample for this can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/lankaapura/Angular-AspNetCore-Idsvr\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/configure-library-for-implicit-flow-without-discovery-document.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/configure-library-for-implicit-flow-without-discovery-document.html","title":"additional-page - Configure Library for Implicit Flow without discovery document","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nConfigure Library for Implicit Flow (without discovery document)\nWhen you don't have a discovery document, you have to configure more properties manually:\nPlease note that the following sample uses the original config API.

This ensures that all of the endpoints provided via the ID Provider discovery document share the same base URL as the issuer parameter.\nSeveral ID Providers (i.e. Google OpenID, WS02-IS, PingOne) provide different domains or path params for various endpoints in the discovery document. These providers may still adhere to the OpenID Connect Provider Configuration specification, but will fail to pass this library's discovery document validation.\nTo use this library with an ID Provider that does not maintain a consistent base URL across the discovery document endpoints, set the strictDiscoveryDocumentValidation parameter to false in your configuration:\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // The SPA's id.

This is the OAuth2/OIDC flow which was originally intended for Single Page Application. \nMeanwhile using Code Flow instead is a best practice and with OAuth 2.1 implicit flow will be deprecated*.\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // The SPA's id.

The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n}Configure the OAuthService with this config object when the application starts up:\nimport { OAuthService } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\nimport { authConfig } from './auth.config';\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'flight-app',\n    templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n      this.configure();\n    }\n\n    private configure() {\n      this.oauthService.configure(authConfig);\n      this.oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();\n      this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();\n    }\n}Implementing a Login Form\nAfter you've configured the library, you just have to call initImplicitFlow to login using OAuth2/ OIDC.\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { OAuthService } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\n\n@Component({\n    templateUrl: \"app/home.html\"\n})\nexport class HomeComponent {\n\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n    }\n\n    public login() {\n        this.oauthService.initLoginFlow();\n    }\n\n    public logoff() {\n        this.oauthService.logOut();\n    }\n\n    public get name() {\n        let claims = this.oauthService.getIdentityClaims();\n        if (!claims) return null;\n        return claims.given_name;\n    }\n\n}The following snippet contains the template for the login page:\n\n    Hallo\n\n\n    Hallo, {{name}}\n\n\n\n    Login\n\n\n    Logout\n\n\n\n    Username/Passwort zum Testen: max/geheim\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/using-password-flow.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/using-password-flow.html","title":"additional-page - Using Password Flow","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nUsing Password-Flow\nThis section shows how to use the password flow, which demands the user to directly enter his or her password into the client.\nPlease note that from an OAuth2/OIDC perspective, the code flow is better suited for logging into a SPA and the flow described here should only be used,\nwhen a) there is a strong trust relations ship between the client and the auth server and when b) other flows are not possible.\nPlease also note that with OAuth 2.1, password flow will be deprecated. \nConfigure Library for Password Flow (using discovery document)\nTo configure the library you just have to set some properties on startup. For this, the following sample uses the constructor of the AppComponent which is called before routing kicks in.\nPlease not, that this configuration is quite similar to the one for the implcit flow.\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n\n        // The SPA's id. Register SPA with this id at the auth-server\n        this.oauthService.clientId = \"demo-resource-owner\";\n\n        // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n        // The auth-server used here only returns a refresh token (see below), when the scope offline_access is requested\n        this.oauthService.scope = \"openid profile email voucher offline_access\";\n\n        // Use setStorage to use sessionStorage or another implementation of the TS-type Storage\n        // instead of localStorage\n        this.oauthService.setStorage(sessionStorage);\n\n        // Set a dummy secret\n        // Please note that the auth-server used here demand the client to transmit a client secret, although\n        // the standard explicitly cites that the password flow can also be used without it. Using a client secret\n        // does not make sense for a SPA that runs in the browser. That's why the property is called dummyClientSecret\n        // Using such a dummy secret is as safe as using no secret.\n        this.oauthService.dummyClientSecret = \"geheim\";\n\n        // Load Discovery Document and then try to login the user\n        let url = 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity/.well-known/openid-configuration';\n        this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocument(url).then(() => {\n            // Do what ever you want here\n        });\n\n  }\n\n}Configure Library for Password Flow (without discovery document)\nIn cases where you don't have an OIDC based discovery document you have to configure some more properties manually:\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n\n        // Login-Url\n        this.oauthService.tokenEndpoint = \"https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity/connect/token\";\n\n        // Url with user info endpoint\n        // This endpont is described by OIDC and provides data about the loggin user\n        // This sample uses it, because we don't get an id_token when we use the password flow\n        // If you don't want this lib to fetch data about the user (e. g. id, name, email) you can skip this line\n        this.oauthService.userinfoEndpoint = \"https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity/connect/userinfo\";\n\n        // The SPA's id. Register SPA with this id at the auth-server\n        this.oauthService.clientId = \"demo-resource-owner\";\n\n        // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n        this.oauthService.scope = \"openid profile email voucher offline_access\";\n\n        // Set a dummy secret\n        // Please note that the auth-server used here demand the client to transmit a client secret, although\n        // the standard explicitly cites that the password flow can also be used without it. Using a client secret\n        // does not make sense for a SPA that runs in the browser. That's why the property is called dummyClientSecret\n        // Using such a dummy secret is as safe as using no secret.\n        this.oauthService.dummyClientSecret = \"geheim\";\n\n  }\n\n}Fetching an Access Token by providing the current user's credentials\nthis.oauthService.fetchTokenUsingPasswordFlow('max', 'geheim').then((resp) => {\n\n      // Loading data about the user\n      return this.oauthService.loadUserProfile();\n\n}).then(() => {\n\n      // Using the loaded user data\n      let claims = this.oAuthService.getIdentityClaims();\n      if (claims) console.debug('given_name', claims.given_name);\n\n})There is also a short form for fetching the token and loading the user profile:\nthis.oauthService.fetchTokenUsingPasswordFlowAndLoadUserProfile('max', 'geheim').then(() => {\n      let claims = this.oAuthService.getIdentityClaims();\n      if (claims) console.debug('given_name', claims.given_name);\n});Refreshing the current Access Token\nUsing the password flow you MIGHT get a refresh token (which isn't the case with the implicit flow by design!). You can use this token later to get a new access token, e. g. after it expired.\nthis.oauthService.refreshToken().then(() => {\n          console.debug('ok');\n})\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/configure-custom-oauthstorage.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/configure-custom-oauthstorage.html","title":"additional-page - Configure custom OAuthStorage","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nConfigure custom OAuthStorage\nThis library uses sessionStorage as the default storage provider. You can customize this by using localStorage or your own storage solution.\nUsing localStorage\nIf  you want to use localStorage instead of sessionStorage, you can add a provider to your AppModule. This works as follows:\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { OAuthModule } from 'a-9-oidc-oauth2';\n// etc.\n\n// We need a factory, since localStorage is not available during AOT build time.\nexport function storageFactory() : OAuthStorage {\n  return localStorage\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [ \n    // etc.\n    HttpClientModule,\n    OAuthModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent,\n    HomeComponent,\n    // etc.\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [\n    AppComponent \n  ],\n  providers: [\n    { provide: OAuthStorage, useFactory: storageFactory }\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Custom storage solution\nIf you want to use a custom storage solution, you can extend the OAuthStorage class. Documentation can be found here. Then add it as a provider, just like in the localStorage example above.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/manually-skipping-login-form.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/manually-skipping-login-form.html","title":"additional-page - Manually Skipping Login Form","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nManually Skipping the Login Form\nFirst, try to use the loadDiscoveryDocumentAndLogin method instead of loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin.

For this, the following sample uses the constructor of the AppComponent which is called before routing kicks in.\nPlease note that the following sample uses the original config API. For information about the new config API have a look to the project's README above.\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n\n        // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n        this.oauthService.redirectUri = window.location.origin + \"/index.html\";\n\n        // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n        this.oauthService.clientId = \"spa-demo\";\n\n        // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n        // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n        this.oauthService.scope = \"openid profile email voucher\";\n\n        // The name of the auth-server that has to be mentioned within the token\n        this.oauthService.issuer = \"https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity\";\n\n        // Load Discovery Document and then try to login the user\n        this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocument().then(() => {\n\n            // This method just tries to parse the token(s) within the url when\n            // the auth-server redirects the user back to the web-app\n            // It dosn't send the user the the login page\n            this.oauthService.tryLogin();\n\n        });\n\n  }\n\n}If you find yourself receiving errors related to discovery document validation, your ID Provider may have OAuth2 endpoints that do not use the issuer value as a consistent base URL. You can turn off strict validation of discovery document endpoints for this scenario. See Discovery Document Validation for details.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/authorization-servers.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/authorization-servers.html","title":"additional-page - Authorization Servers","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nSupport for Auth Servers\nAs this lib follows the OAuth2 and OpenId Connect specs, it should work with all compliant authorizations servers.\nHowever, experience shows that some authorizations servers come with some special behavior or settings.
